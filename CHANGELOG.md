# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## 1.0.0

First stable release. High-level themes (see earlier entries for incremental detail):

- **Shader layout:** Merged `reshade-shaders/Shaders/` and `Textures/` trees with correctness-first **path conflict** handling (skip entire conflicting repo; deterministic order).
- **Plugin add-ons:** Official **Addons.ini**–driven installs; companion shaders/textures use the same merged layout as shader repos.
- **CLI (`rsm`):** Parity with core flows (catalog, shaders, add-ons, ReShade, game inspect).
- **GTK:** Shader and add-on tables with search and sorting; **Recent games** list.
- **Packaging:** AppImage workflow, icons, and desktop integration polish.
- **Stabilization:** Polishing, regression tests, removal of active **`ReShade.ini`** management (ReShade owns its config); documentation and manual QA alignment for release.
- **ReShade / Wine:** Ensure `d3dcompiler_47.dll` when missing by downloading from the Lutris tools mirror (`https://lutris.net/files/tools/dll/d3dcompiler_47.dll`, same stable URL as SteamTinkerLaunch), caching under XDG data, and copying next to the game. The ReShade installer does not ship this DLL. Does not overwrite an existing file. When RSM installs the DLL, it is listed in `installed_reshade_files` (Linux/Wine layout) and removed with other ReShade binaries; a file that was already in the game directory is left untracked.

## 0.8.0

Release-candidate stabilization: clarity, consistency, and regression coverage—no new major features.

### Removed

- **ReShade.ini management:** RSM no longer creates or edits `ReShade.ini` (including `EffectSearchPaths` / `TextureSearchPaths`). ReShade owns its own config at runtime. Removed `reshade_shader_manager.core.ini`, the `create_ini_if_missing` app setting (still ignored if present in an older `config.json`), and `tests/test_ini.py`.

### Changed

- **CLI (`rsm`):** Clearer subcommand descriptions; `--game-dir` documented consistently with `DIR` metavar; `--help` epilog documents exit codes (`0` / `1` / `2` / `130`). `GameManifest` import fixed for type accuracy; `ValueError` paths use the same exception formatter as other user-facing errors.
- **GTK:** “Manage shaders” / “Manage plugin add-ons” dialog titles align with buttons; search fields clarify which columns are filtered; recent-games empty state wording (“No recent games yet.”).

### Added

- **Tests:** CLI coverage for `reshade check` / `reshade remove` without a manifest, and `addons apply` without `--addon`.

### Documentation

- **README:** GTK/CLI wording updated (removed stale version labels); **dx8** listed in graphics APIs; **CLI exit codes** table; roadmap note for v1.0 direction.
- **`docs/MANUAL_QA.md`:** Short manual regression checklist for RC/release verification.

## 0.7.1

### Fixed

- **AppImage / desktop integration:** The packaged `.desktop` file is named `io.github.rsm.reshade_shader_manager.desktop` so its basename matches the GTK `application_id` in `main.py`. This aligns with the [GTK requirement](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Application.html) that the desktop entry ID match the application ID, fixing missing or generic icons in the Wayland titlebar and in app menus that resolve icons via the desktop file.

## 0.7.0

### Added

- **AppImage:** Pre-rendered hicolor PNGs (64–512), `reshade-shader-manager.png` at AppDir root, desktop `Categories`/`Keywords`, and `make_icon.py` validation so the build does not require ImageMagick.
- **GTK:** Main window sets `icon_name` to `reshade-shader-manager` for window and taskbar integration when the icon theme provides that name.

### Documentation

- `packaging/README.md`: where AppImage icons live and how to regenerate PNGs offline.

### Packaging

- `build_appimage.sh` reads the AppImage filename version from `pyproject.toml` unless `RSM_APPIMAGE_VERSION` is set.

## 0.6.0

### Changed

- **Manage shaders…** and **Manage plugin add-ons…** use a **searchable table** (`Gtk.ColumnView`) with columns **Enabled**, **Name**, **Author**, **Description**, and **Source**, default **Name** sort, and a **search bar** (case-insensitive substring over those fields). **Column headers** sort the table (`Gtk.SortListModel` / `Gtk.StringSorter`); click a header to sort, click again to reverse. The **Enabled** column sorts unchecked-before-checked when ascending (and the opposite when descending). Enable/disable toggles and **Apply** behavior are unchanged; selection state is kept when filtering rows.

### Added

- **`ui/catalog_search`** — shared substring matching helper (used by both dialogs).
- **`ui/catalog_column_view`** — shared list model, filter, and column view setup.

## 0.5.0

### Added

- **CLI (`rsm`):** A stdlib `argparse` command-line interface over the same backend as the GTK app (no GTK import). Console script **`rsm`** alongside **`reshade-shader-manager`**. Commands include:
  - `rsm catalog refresh` — re-fetch PCGW shader list, merged shader catalog, and official Addons.ini plugin catalog (same as GUI **Refresh catalog**).
  - `rsm shaders apply` / `rsm shaders update-clones` — shader projection with optional `--git-pull`; bulk `git pull` for existing clones (same as **Update local clones**).
  - `rsm addons apply` / `rsm addons refresh-catalog` — plugin add-on install/reconcile and optional Addons.ini-only metadata refresh.
  - `rsm reshade install|update|remove|check` — ReShade binary install/update/remove/check.
  - `rsm game inspect` — print saved manifest (optional `--json`).
- **`core/catalog_ops.fetch_merged_catalogs`** — shared catalog fetch used by the GUI and CLI.
- **`core/error_format`** — exception formatting shared by CLI and UI (UI module re-exports for compatibility).

## 0.4.0

### Added

- **Recent games:** The Target section lists up to **6** previously saved games from `~/.config/.../games/*.json`, ordered by manifest **file modification time** (newest first). Invalid files are skipped while scanning so the list can still fill with valid entries; duplicate installs are deduplicated by canonical game directory (newest manifest file wins). Each row shows a short display name (from `game_exe` when set, otherwise the game folder name) and an optional shortened path. Click a row to select that game the same way as **Game directory…**. If the folder no longer exists, a clear error is shown. **No new manifest fields or schema changes.**

### Notes

- Version 0.4 is a usability-focused release: quicker game switching without extra configuration. Shader repositories, plugin add-ons (Addons.ini), ReShade install flows, and manifest formats from v0.3 are unchanged aside from this UI addition.

## 0.3.0

### Added

- **Startup catalog hydration:** Shader and plugin add-on catalogs load in the background after the window appears (cache-first, same TTL/stale behavior as before). **Manage shaders…**, **Manage plugin add-ons…**, and **Update local clones** are disabled until that load finishes.
- **Human-readable game manifests:** Preferred path `games/{slug}-{fp8}.json` (`fp8` = first 8 hex chars of the existing per-directory hash). Legacy `games/<full-sha256>.json` files are still found when loading a game and are migrated lazily on load/save (no full-directory scan at startup).

### Changed

- **Refresh catalog** is the only action that forces a network refresh (`force_refresh=True`); its tooltip describes that behavior.
- **PCGW user-agent** string uses the installed package version from metadata.

## 0.2.0

### Added

- **Plugin add-ons (official upstream only):** Fetch and cache ReShade `Addons.ini` from the reshade-shaders repository, present entries in **Manage plugin add-ons…**, and install/remove plugin DLLs (and optional companion files from archives) into the game directory with manifest tracking. No user-defined add-on catalog; no `plugin_addons.json`.

### Notes

- Version 0.2 focuses on shipping the official Addons.ini–based plugin add-on flow alongside existing ReShade and shader-repository management. Deferred items (CLI, multi-profile per game, Flatpak publication) remain out of scope unless listed in a future release.

## 0.1.0

Initial public shape: GTK 4 UI, ReShade install/remove/check, shader repo catalog (built-in, user `repos.json`, PCGW cache), per-game symlink projection, DX8 (d3d8to9) path where applicable.
